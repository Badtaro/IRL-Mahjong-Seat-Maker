Accept all players from text file, separate by \n  (Also says how many rounds there will be)
Give every player a random number (1-100000)
Take player number divide by 4, that is the amount of groups we have rounded up.
Randomize players into tables for R1
Assign Seat positions, take the numbers from before and do a...
E = lowest number N =highest, tie break with player name alphabetical
After R1 we want to build new groupings. This is done by trying all the combinations and picking the one with the lowest score.
A table can be 1 sub minimum, so three actual plays minimum as well.  A sub is never allowed to play against another sub.

ANOTHER WAY: Score is player has a score and group has a score.  Player seat order is fixed (they rotate N->E->S->W->reset) unless they are playing another player within their group. (North R1 player playing a North R1 player).

THIS IS ONE WAY: What is score? Well a player has a score and a Group has a score. A player score is base 1. If they are repeating a seat they've been it adds 100 (400 if their second time) to their score until they've been all four seats. If they are replaying a person they've played before it adds 100 (400 if its their second, 1600 if its their third) to their score. Group score is all player score on that table added up.





SO Weight is separate, only for making distinct table groupings
We will have a separate weight that will add on after table grouping is made to try and make seat winds. I am
going to pray this concept works.
